Reconstruct 3D image from 2D-3 point perspective image of an object.

&nbsp;
### Steps:
### Annotation code: 
  - To get the 2D coordinates of an object
### Final code: 
  - To compute vanishing points </br>
  - To calculate reference length, projection, and homography matrices </br>
  - To create texture maps
### Blender:
  - Reconstruct object using cropped images of texture maps
