Reconstruct 3D image from 2D-3 point perspective image of an object.

Steps:
Annotation code: 
  - To get the 2D coordinates of an object
Final code: 
  - To compute vanishing points
  - To calculate reference length, projection, and homography matrices
  - To create texture maps
Blender:
  - Reconstruct object using cropped images of texture maps
